Just to call this method:

### My eclipse project only has a main project
* Create a hello world Project using Android Studio

* For library project, Move generated Android Studio Project in root folder

### Post work
Your still need to configure your app info (minSdkVersion something like this) in your main module **build.gradle**:
something like those:
```groovy
defaultConfig {
    applicationId "your package name"
    minSdkVersion 15
    targetSdkVersion 23
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
}
```
and **signingConfigs** too.
For more information: check <http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide> this post.
This guide helps me a lot when I am learning gradle.

A lot more:
* adding all your projects in **settings.gradle**
* manage in your library dependency in libarary **build.gradle**
* You will still need a little effort to make your project compile in most cases
